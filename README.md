## What We’re Building

We’re building a **decentralized fire insurance protocol** on Soroban to bring **automated payouts, transparency, and fairness** to wildfire-prone regions where traditional insurance is failing.

Using trusted oracles for wildfire data and smart contracts for enforcement, we’re showing how blockchain can turn a slow, opaque process into one that’s **data-driven and instant**. This is a **hackathon MVP**, meant to showcase what’s possible with our flexible insurance framework—not a finished product, but a glimpse of what’s coming.


## Why It Matters

We have family in Northern California, not far from Paradise—where the 2018 wildfire destroyed an entire town. While browsing real estate nearby, we found nearly every property flagged as “Extreme Risk” with **9/10 Fire Factor™** and up to **48% wildfire probability** over 30 years.

Insurers are pulling out or raising premiums. Claims, if covered at all, are slow and frustrating. The system is broken across the board.

The recent case of **Luigi Mangione**, who tragically shot a healthcare executive over a denied claim, had nothing to do with fire insurance—but it reflects the **growing anger toward an industry that’s opaque, adversarial, and outdated**. It’s clear: insurance across most verticals needs a reset.

## Our Journey

This builds on our work from a **Kickstarter grant by the Stellar Foundation (Oct 2024)**. That support helped us launch a flight delay insurance POC—where users are paid automatically if their flight is delayed beyond a set threshold.

We’re now **restructuring the framework** to make it more **robust and production-ready**, with broader insurance use cases in mind.

## Open for Collaboration

This fire insurance demo is just the beginning. Our framework is **modular and extensible**—any team can use it to build insurance products for any vertical, **as long as reliable oracle data exists**.

We're applying for the **BUIDL award** with our real flight insurance product, and we’re inviting other builders to join us in disrupting the rest of the insurance industry.
